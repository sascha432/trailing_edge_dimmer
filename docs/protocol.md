# I2C/UART protocol

The dimmer is controlled via I2C or UART interface.

The default address is 0x17 for the slave. When sending data, the dimmer acts as master and sends to address 0x18 (slave address + 1).

The values for the registers and commands can be found in [dimmer_protocol.h](../src/dimmer_protocol.h)

The examples are using the UART protocol and can send to the dimmer using any terminal software.

Using the Arduino TwoWire class (or the drop-in replacement for UART [SerialTwoWire](https://github.com/sascha432/i2c_uart_bridge)) instead:


    // +i2ct=17,89,22
    Wire.beginTransmission(DIMMER_I2C_ADDRESS);
    Wire.write(DIMMER_REGISTER_COMMAND);
    Wire.write(DIMMER_COMMAND_READ_VCC);
    if (Wire.endTransmission() == 0) {

        // +i2cr=17,02
        uint16_t vcc;
        if (Wire.requestFrom(DIMMER_I2C_ADDRESS, sizeof(vcc)) == sizeof(vcc)) {
            Wire.readBytes(reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t *>(&vcc), sizeof(vcc));
        }
    }


## DIMMER_COMMAND_FADE

The fading command uses following registers

- DIMMER_REGISTER_FROM_LEVEL (int16, little endian)
- DIMMER_REGISTER_CHANNEL (int8)
- DIMMER_REGISTER_TO_LEVEL (int16)
- DIMMER_REGISTER_TIME (float, 32bit, little endian)

The fade command can be sent in a single write operation.

### From level

If set to -1 / 0xffff, it will start with the current level set. The default value is -1.

### Channel

Channels are 0 based and -1 / 0xff means all channels

### Examples

Set *from level* to -1, *channel* to 0, *to level* to 0x0301, *time* 7.5 (seconds) and execute fade command

    +i2ct=17,80,ff,ff,00,03,01,00,00,f0,40,11
                ^^^^^ from level           ^^ command
                      ^^ channnel
                         ^^^^^ to level
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^ time

Short version

    +i2ct=7580ffff0003000000f04011

Assuming *from level* is the default -1, set *channel* to -1, *to level* to 0x0301, *time* 7.5

    +i2ct=17,82,ff,03,01,00,00,f0,40,11

## DIMMER_COMMAND_SET_LEVEL

The fading command uses following registers

- DIMMER_REGISTER_CHANNEL (int8)
- DIMMER_REGISTER_TO_LEVEL (int16)

Set *channel* to 1, *to level* to 777 (0x0309) and execute set level command

    +i2ct=17,82,01,09,03
    +i2ct=17,89,10

To send the command in one transmission, the time can be filled with any data

    +i2ct=17,82,01,09,03,00,00,00,00,10

## DIMMER_COMMAND_READ_xxx

This applies to

- DIMMER_COMMAND_READ_NTC (float)
- DIMMER_COMMAND_READ_INT_TEMP (float)
- DIMMER_COMMAND_READ_VCC (uint16)

If no further data is sent after the read command, the register is set automatically to

- DIMMER_REGISTER_TEMP (float)
- DIMMER_REGISTER_VCC (uint16)

Read VCC

    +i2ct=17,89,22
    +i2cr=17,02

Response (0x3613 = 4.918V)

    +I2CT=753613

Read internal temperature

    +i2ct=17,89,21
    +i2cr=17,04

Read int. temp and VCC

In this example, *DIMMER_REGISTER_READ_LENGTH* is set manually to 6 byte, followed by the start address *DIMMER_REGISTER_TEMP*

    +i2ct=17,89,21,89,22,8a,06,9c
    +i2cr=17,06

If the temperature is requested last, it is not required to set read length and register address

    +i2ct=17,89,22,89,21
    +i2cr=17,06


Read AC frequency

    +i2ct=17,89,23
    +i2cr=17,04


## DIMMER_COMMAND_READ_CHANNELS

Read one or more channel

- DIMMER_REGISTER_CH0_LEVEL (int16)
- DIMMER_REGISTER_CH1_LEVEL
- DIMMER_REGISTER_CH2_LEVEL
- DIMMER_REGISTER_CH3_LEVEL
- DIMMER_REGISTER_CH4_LEVEL
- DIMMER_REGISTER_CH5_LEVEL
- DIMMER_REGISTER_CH6_LEVEL
- DIMMER_REGISTER_CH7_LEVEL

The byte after command specifies the number of channels and start address, each 4 bit. If omitted, all 8 channels are read.

Channel 1 - 4

    +i2ct=17,89,12,40
    +i2cr=17,08

Channel 8

    +i2ct=17,89,12,17
    +i2cr=17,02

Channel 2 and 3

    +i2ct=17,89,12,21
    +i2cr=17,04

## DIMMER_COMMAND_WRITE_EEPROM

    +i2ct=17,89,ee

Dump macros for the register memory.

    +i2ct=17,89,ef

## Temperature, VCC status and AC Frequency

If temperature reporting is enabled, the dimmer sends the temperature, VCC and AC frequency to it's own I2C address + 1.

The register address DIMMER_TEMPERATURE_REPORT indicates temperature (uint8), VCC (uint16) and frequency (float)

    +I2CT=18F022E212426E5C29

## Temperature Alarm

If the max. temperature was exceeded, it sends one alarm with register address DIMMER_TEMPERATURE_ALERT, the current temperature (uint8) and the temperature threshold (uint8)

    +I2CT=18F16A64

## Fading completed

When fading to a new level has been completed, the dimmer sends DIMMER_FADING_COMPLETE, with channel (int8) and level (int16). Channel and level can occur multiple times in the case 2 channels finished at the same time.

Channel 0 and 1 reached 0x1234 and fading is complete:

    +I2CT=18F2001234011234

Channel 0 reached level 0:

    +I2CT=18F2000000
