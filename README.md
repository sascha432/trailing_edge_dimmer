# Trailing Edge MOSFET Dimmer

Firmware for a trailing edge MOSFET dimmer.

* 14bit / 16666 different dimming levels
* Up to 8 different channels
* Store last levels in EEPROM and restore during startup
* EEPROM wear level protection
* Serial protocol to control the dimmer
* I2C or UART interface
* Over temperature protection using an external NTC or the internal ATmega temperature sensor
* Highly configurable to match any hardware

## New and improved in-wall dimmer STL files

I have improved and updated the housing for the in-wall dimmer and added print instructions.

* Switches can be mounted on a PCB attached to the plate
* Space for 2 optional LEDs
* Invisible hole for reset switch
* Space for a 20mm fuse holder
* Labels for wires

## New plugin version for 1 Channel Dimmer

Check section [3D models](#3D-models-released) for a plugin housing.

## Updated 4 Channel Dimmer with Power Monitoring

Non isolated version with an offline primary side buck regulator (LNK306), reduced standby consumption of 0.45W compared to 0.58W of the 1 Channel dimmer. Up to 500W with heatsink.

## Power Monitoring

I've finished testing the new power monitoring feature based on HLW8012 and compatible chips.
The new design uses the Hi-link 3.3V/1A power supply and the MP150, an offline primary side buck regulator, for the non-isolated 5V rail. The regular dimmer got an update as well and 4 MOSFETs can be installed to increase the maximum power up to 200/400W.

## WiFi Firmware update

The recent version of the KFC firmware supports programming the ATmega over the STK500v1 protocol directly from the ESP8266. I am using the Arduino bootloader for the ATmega328P mini PRO board@8MHz (ATmegaBOOT_168_atmega328_pro_8MHz.hex)

## Zero crossing detection update

I've improved the zero crossing detection by adding a RC filter, which improves the signal but still has a 0.5% error rate compared to 2.2% before.
Software filtering reduces the error rate to 0.001% even without the RC filter.

Test environment: 4x10W LED + 60W incandescent bulb, 50% dimmed, random 1000-2500V transients 5-20Âµs several times per second on the AC side.

Testing it with a PWM generator to simulate the zero crossing signal, dimming a LED instead switching the MOSFET. The 120V part is waiting for opto couplers.

## Schematics of the final design

* 3.3V only
* Improved power consumption (~0.3-0.4W idle depending on the power supply)
* Improved MOSFET switching
